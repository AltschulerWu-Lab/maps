    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook trains multiclass classification models to generate i-MAP scores for distinguishing between multiple genetic/phenotypic groups using high-content imaging data. The pipeline implements in-silico multiplexing by integrating cellular profiles from multiple marker combinations imaged across separate plates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow:**\n",
    "1. **Configuration**: Set analysis parameters including screen name, marker combinations, and genetic classification scheme\n",
    "2. **Data Loading**: Load single-cell imaging features from multiple marker sets using the `ImageScreenMultiAntibody` class\n",
    "3. **Preprocessing**: Filter and normalize features (remove missing/constant features, filter outlier cells, standardize measurements)\n",
    "4. **Model Training**: Train deep learning classifiers using the MAP (Molecular ALS Phenotype) analysis framework with cross-validation strategies (e.g., leave-one-out, sample splits)\n",
    "5. **Model Saving**: Serialize trained models and analysis results for downstream evaluation and scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "- **Model Architecture**: Multi-marker deep learning classifier with hierarchical encoders (marker-specific → cell-level → sample-level)\n",
    "- **Training Strategy**: Two-phase training with per-marker early stopping followed by integrated model optimization\n",
    "- **Sample Splits**: Configurable cross-validation (leave-one-out or fixed train/test splits) ensuring unbiased predictions on held-out samples\n",
    "- **Output**: Trained models with predicted class probabilities and feature importances saved to disk\n",
    "\n",
    "The trained models can be used to score new samples or evaluate classification performance on held-out data."
