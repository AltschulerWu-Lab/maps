    "# Overview\n",
    "This notebook shows a basic use case for the multiantibody, multiclass analysis using the MAPs framework. To handle multimarker analysis, we define a new image screen class `ImageScreenMultiAntibody`, the key difference being that it will handle loading / returning datasets from multiple antibodies simultaneously. Data preprocessing is handled as in the single marker analysis-by defining steps within the `preprocess` key of the params file-and applied independently for each loaded marker set."
